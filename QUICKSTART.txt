QUICK START GUIDE - Data Drift Monitor
======================================

Follow these steps to get started in 2 minutes!

STEP 1: Install Dependencies
-----------------------------
pip install -r requirements.txt

STEP 2: Generate Sample Data
-----------------------------
python generate_sample_data.py

This creates 5 CSV files:
✓ reference_data.csv (baseline)
✓ current_data_no_drift.csv (control)
✓ current_data_moderate_drift.csv (some drift)
✓ current_data_severe_drift.csv (significant drift)
✓ current_data_progressive_drift.csv (gradual drift)

STEP 3: Launch the App
-----------------------
streamlit run app.py

The app will open at http://localhost:8501

STEP 4: Upload Data
-------------------
In the sidebar:
1. Upload "reference_data.csv" as Reference Dataset
2. Select "churn" as the target column
3. Upload "current_data_severe_drift.csv" as Incoming Data

STEP 5: Process Batches
------------------------
1. Set batch size to 100 (default)
2. Click "Process Next Batch" repeatedly
3. Watch the drift detection in action!

STEP 6: Explore Features
-------------------------
Navigate through the tabs:

📈 DATA DRIFT
- View drift table with color-coded severity
- See global drift overview charts
- Analyze individual features
- Check drift timelines
- Examine drift heatmap

🧠 CONCEPT DRIFT
- Monitor target variable shifts
- Understand concept vs data drift
- See target distribution comparison

🚨 ALERTS
- Review all drift warnings
- Filter by severity
- Track alert history

💾 EXPORT
- Download CSV summaries
- Export JSON history

UNDERSTANDING THE RESULTS
--------------------------

PSI (Population Stability Index):
• < 0.10: No significant drift ✅
• 0.10 - 0.25: Moderate drift ⚠️
• > 0.25: Severe drift 🚨

KS Statistic:
• < 0.05: No significant drift ✅
• 0.05 - 0.10: Moderate drift ⚠️
• > 0.10: Severe drift 🚨

WHAT TO DO IF DRIFT IS DETECTED
--------------------------------

1. INVESTIGATE
   - Check data quality issues
   - Verify upstream data changes
   - Review business context

2. ANALYZE
   - Which features are drifting?
   - Is it data drift or concept drift?
   - Is it gradual or sudden?

3. DECIDE
   - Minor drift: Monitor closely
   - Moderate drift: Plan retraining
   - Severe drift: Take immediate action

4. ACT
   - Fix data pipeline issues
   - Retrain model with new data
   - Update monitoring thresholds
   - Document findings

TESTING DIFFERENT SCENARIOS
----------------------------

Scenario 1: No Drift
Upload: current_data_no_drift.csv
Expected: All green, no alerts

Scenario 2: Moderate Drift  
Upload: current_data_moderate_drift.csv
Expected: Orange warnings, some alerts

Scenario 3: Severe Drift
Upload: current_data_severe_drift.csv
Expected: Red alerts, many features drifting

Scenario 4: Progressive Drift
Upload: current_data_progressive_drift.csv
Expected: Drift increases over batches

TIPS FOR PRODUCTION USE
------------------------

1. Set appropriate thresholds based on your domain
2. Monitor regularly (daily for critical models)
3. Combine with model performance monitoring
4. Export reports for documentation
5. Investigate alerts promptly
6. Track drift patterns over time

TROUBLESHOOTING
----------------

Problem: "No module named 'streamlit'"
Solution: pip install -r requirements.txt

Problem: "Schema mismatch"
Solution: Ensure incoming data has same columns as reference

Problem: "No drift detected"
Solution: Try current_data_severe_drift.csv to see obvious drift

Problem: App not updating
Solution: Click "Process Next Batch" to trigger updates

NEXT STEPS
----------

1. Try with your own datasets
2. Experiment with different thresholds
3. Monitor your production models
4. Integrate with your MLOps pipeline
5. Customize for your specific needs

Happy Monitoring! 🎉
